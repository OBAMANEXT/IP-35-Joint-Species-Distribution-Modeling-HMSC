# IP-35-Joint-Species-Distribution-Modeling-HMSC

This product is built on the Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) framework, a Bayesian hierarchical joint species distribution modeling (JSDM) approach applied to benthic seaweed and invertebrate communities. HMSC enables the simultaneous modeling of multiple species while accounting for co-occurrence patterns and environmental dependencies. By accommodating the multivariate nature of community data, it is particularly well-suited for benthic seaweed ecosystems, where shared environmental responses and strong interactions among habitat-forming species, seaweeds, and invertebrates are expected. In addition, the Bayesian framework in HMSC provides a robust approach for quantifying uncertainties in parameter estimates and predictions, which is essential given the inherent measurement errors and natural variability in ecological data. HMSC is especially useful for modeling host species linked to habitat-formers, which single-species models struggle with. It also provides a strong community perspective, key for habitat modeling.
